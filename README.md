# Slac
Slac is an abbreviated form of the Stay late and code. This is a group of people who stay later after their work hours. They code, learn and complete projects. This website is designed mainly with the purpose of getting track of a number of hours a person is working late at night. We the group members have made it in such a way that a particular person can login only if s(he) is in the prescribed premises (i.e within the working area or office). We have a single admin account which has all the access and admin rights to approve/disapprove a newly signed up member. The user can login only with the unique id, which can be changed only by the admin account. The admin account also has the authority to remove an existing member of the group.
